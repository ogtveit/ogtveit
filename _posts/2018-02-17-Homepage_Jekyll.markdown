So i created this with the help of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). And the reason, you ask? I know you didn't ask, but I'll go ahead and tell anyway. It's all the people saying "you just HAVE to build an online prescence", "it's for your career, silly", etc. Well, nobody have actually told my face this, but random people have written it online I guess.
